# Firebrat

I was asked to create a simple crawler for one of my interviews long ago, and
it was sitting in a bitbucket repository for long. It had basic requirements
and an output to the shell.
So I decided to port it to github , integrate with Flask, some bootstrap
prettification, count word occurences, save in mongodb  and show them in d3js graph.
Why? just because I can...
